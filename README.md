# Simon Game

Implementation of the [freeCodeCamp Simon Game
project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game).

I originally made this project [on
Codepen](https://codepen.io/thancock20/pen/NxKrWZ) months ago. This remake is
meant to:
* Move the project off of Codepen.
* Remove the dependencies on jQuery and Bootstrap.
* Use the *How to Design Programs* method learned from the edX course.
* Use the DOM API directly, as learned from the *DOM Enlightenment* book.
* Use ES2015.
* Use Jest for unit tests.

The game (currently not running) is at
